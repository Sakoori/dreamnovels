Script for making interactive dream novels in HTML with JavaScript.

What are Dream Novels?
Dream Novels (DNs) are a type of fanfiction where an original character (OC) is inserted into a story and interacts with a canon character from the media franchise the fanfiction is based off of. Interactive ones allow for a user to input their first and last names in a prompt and the HTML script would replace the default name in the story with their own name. DNs are (typically) written in a third person perspective, so the user can read about themselves falling in love with the main character of the story. They are self-indulgent in nature and are mainly romantic.

This script is very manual. You need to copy/paste the JS sections for every instance of the character's name in the story. Eventually, I'll figure out how to change the script so that it auto-detects the string of characters for the name and replaces them. 

For an example of how to use the script, check out example.html. If you want the actual interactive version to see the final function of the script, check out example.html in action here:
