# dreamnovels

Script for making interactive dream novels in HTML with JavaScript.

This script is very manual. You need to copy/paste the JS sections for every instance of the character's name in the story. Eventually, I'll figure out how to change the script so that it auto-detects the string of characters for the name and replaces them. 

For an example of how to use the script, check out example.html. If you want the actual interactive version to see the final function of the script, check out example.html in action here:
